You have a choice if you want to do buffet or ala carte on food. Rooms are basic which is okay, no tv or internet and I personally believe that it should stay that way so people who come here can bond with each other and enjoy the music of nature. They also have a big pool which my son and I enjoyed. too bad it was not harvest time as my son wanted to go fishing. If you are a bird watcher, this place is for you. we actually saw 7 species. Overall I rate this resort  4.5 out of 5. Bakawan rooms could use some renovation as I noticed sockets are not safe for kids and the wood shelf on both sides of the beds. Other than that it was a blast and I would definitely come back with my family here. We now have a new favorite destination in the south.

Directions:
Input - Balai sa San Juan in Waze and it will direct you to the resort. Make sure to avoid the the national road going to Quezon province (Traffic is bad)",Accommodation,"Stayed last Sept 29 for my wife's bday celebration. We stayed at Bakawan room with balcony.

Ung isang Owner na lalaki Saludo kami sayo Sir napaka-approchable mo dahil sayo kaya kami nag-Stay dyan sa Urbiz.
Pero kung babalikan mas marami at mas magandang Beach Resort at Mabait na owner at mabait na Staff ang La Union.
Im Sorrry,ang place maganda at Relaxing sa twing pupunta kami ng La Union itong Urbiz Garden talaga ang pinupuntahan namin kasi So Relaxing talaga ang place ang Ambience.
Nalunkot lang ako sa Staff at isang Owner.
Be Nice nalang sa mga dumarating na turista kasi ang gusto namin talaga mgrelaks at hindi ma-stress.",Accommodation,"We know that the resort is pet friendly, not an owner is good to talk to because he saw our pomeranian dog is very kind and train, so he agreed that his dog would be in the dorm, not an owner had a lot of conditionsWe still have a dog in the cage if you are a pet lover and you love to take care of the pain of seeing your dog confined to the cage.
They rated P1,390 for each single bed, but we used 1,190 per single bed only three beds, we were charged with 4 beds and breakfast, we didn't even have a breakfast and we only used three beds,
Staff worthless, very different from the resorts we went to,
Another owner who salutes you and we are very approchable because you have stayed there in urbiz.
But if it comes back to more and more beach resorts and kind owners and kind staff are La Union.
Im sorrry, the place is nice and relaxing in the twing we are going to La Union this urbiz garden really is where we go because the ambience is so relaxing.
I just hit the staff and an owner.
Be nice to the coming tourists because we really want to relax and not be stressed.",know resort pet friendly owner good talk saw pomeranian dog kind train agreed dog would dorm owner lot conditionswe still dog cage pet lover love take care pain seeing dog confined cage rated p1390 single bed used 1190 per single bed three bed charged 4 bed breakfast didnt even breakfast used three bed staff worthless different resort went another owner salute approchable stayed urbiz come back beach resort kind owner kind staff la union im sorrry place nice relaxing twing going la union urbiz garden really go ambience relaxing hit staff owner nice coming tourist really want relax stressed,0.078,0.583,0.34,0.9882,positive

Post,Karmela BN,2022-06-06,"@shorebreakhostel is a pet-friendly establishment, so it was a no-brainer for us because we wanted to bring not just one, not just two, but THREE dogs!

I think for non-hypoallergenic dogs, you will only have the choice of booking the bunk beds and not the family room. I think It is a fair decision by the hostel. 

I was hesitant at first to share a bathroom with other guests, but it turned out to be okay thanks to the round the clock cleaning by the kind ates. 

There were three toilet stalls and four sinks shared by guests. I do wish they had a full-length mirror at the side of the bathroom, near the entrance. It would be helpful for contacts application (hehe) and outfit checks. 

There were four working individual shower rooms, with changing area. There was one that needed repair work, which I did notsee fixed in our three-day stay. Maybe a point for improvement? 

For the fur-babies, make sure they have diapers if they are not potty-trained. They do have a potty area shared with Billie, their resident golden retriever 

Parking is limited, but there are nearby areas where you can park for a fee. 

No breakfast included in the booking, but there is a dining area with free cold drinking water. You can order coffee, alcohol, and smoothies. You can also drink and eat at the rooftop deck. 

Wifi was okay. It comes and goes in the upper floors, but it was your best bet for internet connection because the phone signal is weak in the area. 

No cleaning of rooms each day, but I think you can get your towels changed per request. 

11:30 am is the checkout time, not the more common 12nn. Be mindful because they charge a fee (our mistake for not reading!). 

The overall aesthetic of the hostel was simple, clean, but still nice to look at. It certainly stands out in the area. The staffs and owner were all so kind and polite 

We loved staying here - super central to the LU hot spots and just a 5-minute walk to the beach. Highly recommend! Go na.",Accommodation,"@shorebreakhostel is a pet-friendly establishment, so it was a no-brainer for us because we wanted to bring not just one, not just two, but THREE dogs!

Post,Benjo Baltazar ,2024-08-14,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at this incredible beach house last August 9-11, and it exceeded all our expectations.  The property is spacious, providing more than enough room for our group to relax and unwind. Every part of the house is well thought out, with complete amenities that made our stay comfortable and hassle-free. From the fully equipped kitchen to the cozy living spaces and the  bathrooms, everything was clean and well maintained. The location is very nice—just a short walk to the beach, allowing us to enjoy the sand and sea at any time. The outdoor space is just as impressive, the basketball court is a plus, and the pool is superb. the kids enjoyed the pool, just as much as they enjoyed the beach - best of both worlds. What really stood out was the professionalism of the owners. They were a delight to communicate with, always responsive and accommodating to our needs. They clearly take great pride in their property and go the extra mile to ensure their guests have an exceptional experience. Thanks Perry and to your parents!

Prior to booking, I attempted to contact them using the provided number, but it was challenging to get through. When I finally did reach someone, it turned out to be the owner himself. I shared my concern that there would be three of us staying in a room meant for two, and he assured us it would be fine since we had paid for the entire room. However, upon arriving at the location, we were unexpectedly charged an additional P2,000 for the extra bed, despite having had a seemingly positive conversation with the owner 2 weeks prior. This was quite disappointing. 
Furthermore, to our dismay, we found that there were NO TOILETRIES PROVIDED, and we were only given one towel for our entire three-day stay. ONE TOWEL 

Taking everything into account, I Can not help but feel that the overall experience was not worth the price we paid.

Furthermore, to our dismay, we found that there were NO TOILETRIES PROVIDED, and we were only given one towel for our entire three-day stay. ONE TOWEL

Taking everything into account, I Can not help but feel that the overall experience was not worth the price we paid. The place seemed overpriced for what it offered, and the lack of basic amenities and unexpected additional charges were a letdown. Unfortunately, I wouldn't consider returning to this place in the future.",place indeed quite pricey especially considering na sobrang taas location hirap maka akyat pati yung sasakyan prior booking attempted contact using provided number challenging get finally reach someone turned owner shared concern would three u staying room meant two assured u would fine since paid entire room however upon arriving location unexpectedly charged additional p2000 extra bed despite seemingly positive conversation owner 2 week prior quite disappointing furthermore dismay found toiletry provided given one towel entire threeday stay one towel taking everything account help feel overall experience worth price paid place seemed overpriced offered lack basic amenity unexpected additional charge letdown unfortunately wouldnt consider returning place future,0.129,0.748,0.123,-0.5691,negative

There are lots of sand below the pool and it's so hard to open your eye when swimming because it's painful in the eyes. There's only shampoo and conditioner included in the rooms no soap. We book two rooms. The room good for 3 pax has no remote control and they can't provide a replacement for that when we ask the reception. Also the bathroom tiles are dirty and the running water is not heavy. Also we ate breakfast those are free breakfast but we also bought for the other people not counted for free breakfast and its worth P120 and it only contains egg, rice, and you can select from daing, cornbeef or hotdog.

Post,Jesse Saguyod,2024-04-07,"The guard is grumpy. for 11k for 15pax I can say it's not worth it. When we arrived, the balcony where we were supposed to hang out was dirty. We're not artistic, but at least we sweep from time to time, especially when they expect guests. There was no power when we arrived and no water. We arrived at 4pm and got power at 6pm. The mug in the bathroom was still broken, so I couldn't take a comfortable shower. The cr and rooms are also old. The shower head even asked us if it was broken, that they should fix the case because the hand shower doesn't fit in the case so it will probably fall on the floor. Their WiFi had no connection during our entire stay. The attitude of the guard was even worse when we were about to check out. It's not even 11am and we're itching to get kicked out of the house. My friends are still being preached to put away the mess, which is our leftover food that has not yet been in the car that we are going to take home. It's always good to answer.

Post,Vanessa Diaz Fernandez,2024-06-15,"TERRIBLE ACCOMMODATION

We were all looking forward to a nice place to stay in La Union, then we saw this hostel on IG. Their posts were good so we booked. When you get there you will get EXPECTION vs REALITY!! Their posts are super misleading.

1. BAD ATTITUDE OF THE STAFF. Upon check-in, the receptionist's face was blank. So we gave in because maybe we were just tired. But in our 4D3N stay there, it seems like that attitude is not right anymore. ALL STAFF ACTUALLY! I don't know if that's the only one who is always on purpose, it's like you're too shy to talk to them. Even when asking for the WiFi password, they don't seem to want to give it even when they check in! And until check-out, the attitude of their staff is very disappointing, especially the two receptionists who change every morning and night shift.
2. BEDROOM. Given this is a HOSTEL but it seems like you will be made a spider in a small space! You're barely able to move.
3. WATER. If the water is not EXTREMELY WEAK, they have absolutely NO water. The problem with CR is how it doesn't flush well when you urinate because the water is so weak.
4. COMMON AREAS. You can't hang out in their common area because the fan is broken. It's also hard to hang out in the room because it's so small and you can hardly move.",Accommodation,"TERRIBLE ACCOMMODATION

Post,Shai Ra,2019-12-04,"Very poor customer service. It was a very bad resort we had to go to close the restaurant because it did not seem to cook lunch and dinner we were expecting food to be available in this case it did not start that our village should have fun not because we were still looking for a place to eat out. After that we went to the room as soon as we entered it was obvious that it was not being cleaned that time I wanted to go back out in case there was no choice our companions had already paid half because they were there first in the morning we just followed after lunch. So while we were staying and sitting outside the room there were a lot of mosquitoes and fleas eating us because our room was near the doghouse. So I couldn't bear to go into the room so when we were asleep I was so overwhelmed by the amount of bites all over my body until my face was so obvious that they couldn't change their bedsheets and were full of dust take note not just me we were all my friends in bed. before that aftern we had dinner from orbiztondo we were going to night swimming we were in case the pool was very dirty the sand was too much and the water was not clear so we did not swim we said tomorrow it's going to be a long night and they're going to drain it like 10pm-6am it's forbidden to swim so we expect to be clean tomorrow The next day, we had to clean this pool, but the water was not drained and the dirt was not replaced by sand and the water was not clear. Even the surroundings are not cleaned properly. About their breakfast food because that's all they seem to be serving. Not recommended until their facilities and customer service are fixed. That's all that's needed for immediate action. If we were to go back, we would not be able to enjoy our short vacation in this way. But thank you.",Accommodation,"Very poor customer service.

Also, the staff says its also like that in different rooms even louder (second floor).

2) They don't issue any receipts, when we booked it for work we asked for a receipt for it to be re-imbursed, they told us that they will send it to us, up until during check out the staff told me that they dont issue receipts. LIKE WTF? HOW DO YOU GUYS OPERATE?

3) The receptionist is also the cleaning staff that is why they are not that knowledgeable in hotel operations, they had to ask others on most of the inquiries we have.

Post,Riz Estrella - Pendon,2019-05-28,"What I like:
- Easy to find, it’s just along the highway. 
- Has their own parking & it’s big. Can fit around 20 cars I guess or more. Unlike the other resorts, you park your car along the highway at your own risk. 
- Near the food hubs and restaurants. 
- Very nice staffs, both the resort and bar staffs. 
- Though we didn’t order at the Blue but it’s a nice place to chill. 
- Affordable. 



Additional feedback/commendation:
We arrived waaaaay early than our check-in time. We requested for early check-in via our Agoda reservation & they responded that it’s subject to availability which is okay. They offered to place our stuff in the reception area while we chill at the Blue or by the shore. 
Guests from our room checked out past 12 and Kuya Val immediately asked the staff to clean it. He even showed us upstairs, helped bring our stuff & was very welcomy as if he is touring us in his own house. 
While waiting by the reception area, I heard some of the guests were already repeat guests or have been there before. Most of them are foreigners & were very comfortable in talking to the staffs. The staffs in return were very cheerful and hospitable. 
I guess it’s one of the reasons why guests keep on going back to Little Surfmaid. Yes, beach area is not that good and facility needs improvement but since they have great, cheerful and hospital staffs, then I wouldn’t mind. � will definitely recommend.",Accommodation,"What I like:

While waiting by the reception area, I heard some of the guests were already repeat guests or have been there before. Most of them are foreigners & were very comfortable in talking to the staffs. The staffs in return were very cheerful and hospitable.
I guess it’s one of the reasons why guests keep on going back to Little Surfmaid. Yes, beach area is not that good and facility needs improvement but since they have great, cheerful and hospital staffs, then I wouldn’t mind. � will definitely recommend.",like easy find along highway parking big fit around 20 car guess unlike resort park car along highway risk near food hub restaurant nice staff resort bar staff though didnt order blue nice place chill affordable additional feedbackcommendation arrived waaaaay early checkin time requested early checkin via agoda reservation responded subject availability okay offered place stuff reception area chill blue shore guest room checked past 12 kuya val immediately asked staff clean even showed u upstairs helped bring stuff welcomy touring u house waiting reception area heard guest already repeat guest foreigner comfortable talking staff staff return cheerful hospitable guess one reason guest keep going back little surfmaid yes beach area good facility need improvement since great cheerful hospital staff wouldnt mind definitely recommend,0.057,0.696,0.247,0.9821,positive

Their place is a paradise not more than 5mins from the main road but still very peaceful esp at night, talk about perfect location! It was a spontaneous trip coming from Manila, and I was able to book a tent for an overnight stay instantly. Arrived at 8pm and staff we’re very accommodating, they set up my tent, table and chairs by the beach — expect musical ocean waves perfect for the soul. I booked for 2 more nights in their air-conditioned kubo — a very comfortable kubo with a big-ass bed that can fit upto 4 pax and a dining / sala outside your room where you can eat, drink and just basically chill. Let’s talk about food — definitely a bang for the buck! From their silog meals to snacks to their ala-carte dishes. The ate’s are always there to assist you with your order and deliver it to your cabin, def a great service! They are very friendly too! Facility wise, pools are I think cleaned everyday because ive been swimming day and night and water is always clear. There is an open-area where you can charge your gadgets if you’ll avail their tent accommodation. Restroom and Bathroom are common but seperate for male and female are always cleaned by their staff, I am very particular for TandB but was able to use their facilities perfectly fine. The resort staff was one of the most friendliest people I’ve ever met, even compared to 3-5 stars hotels and resorts ive been. They always check on me knowing I traveled alone and cater to things I need. I will definitely go back to oceanaire, not just for the view and facilities which is perfect but more for the staff.

Post,Miko Calayan,2019-08-31,"I have stayed in a couple of places in LU and almost all the hostels. No doubt this is the best. Stayed in this place for 5 days, i had a really awesome experience. 

The location is great. A short walk to the restaurants, highway and beach. Staff was impressive. They were very accommodating and friendly. Their service was really good! I never for once in the whole week see them frown or not smile. All my concerns were always met and they were always happy to help guests with their concerns. I also would like to mention the owners of the hostel, Buji and Nikki. In my experience they are the nicest and best hosts in a hostel. They are very humble and wonderful hosts. 

You will never really feel crowded in this hostel since there are 22 beds overall. I like hostels like this since usually service is better at this number. The rooms are really nice. Its not a basic room. Its simple yet well designed rooms. Sometimes i really feel like i just want to hang out in the room because it's very cozy inside. There are a lot of space for people in the room to put their things. Rooms are all equipped with A/C, perfect for the Philippines as it could be very warm sometimes. Towels and blankets that were provided smelled really good and were clean. All the common areas, toilets, and showers were ALWAYS clean. Also all the tissues, and Body wash were always filled. The hostel also provide an outdoor shower for people coming from the beach or from people coming from surfing. Also a surf rack if guests do bring their boards.

Lastly would like to mention the Roof deck. I love hanging out in that place. It's very chill to hang out there. Great place to meet other guests in the hostel! Oh and there is a Kitchen and Fridge in the roof deck for guests who would want to cook their own food or put some stuff on the fridge. It is also a great place to study and work. There were a couple of guests that i met who were there working in the roof deck. 

Really Good Hostel. The best Hostel in LU and I think in all of the Philippines in my experience. Good Job Guys!",Accommodation,"I have stayed in a couple of places in LU and almost all the hostels. No doubt this is the best. Stayed in this place for 5 days, i had a really awesome experience.

- (2) Bathrooms with each having its own shower head and heater. 
- WATER PRESSURE the bidet is good besides the water
- Pantry area (super convenient since we brought a lot of snacks)
- COMFORTABLE beds (the beds they use are quality. Not cheap and the sheets too are of high quality)
- SPACIOUS (literally lots of room for you to move around, plus the mirror was nice) 
- Free cold/hot water, coffee, and cooking area (commin cooking area but we have solved the problem of cooking breakfast)
- STRATEGIC LOCATION (close to all the GO-TO-SPOTS in Elyu, we just walked all our foot trips because it's right next door. It's also right next to the beach so it's really just a walk trip. It's very economical) 
- PRICE IS AFFORDABLE AND IDEAL (the payment is worth it. Clean. The owners are kind and welcoming, they even gave us recommendations on good places to visit nearby and foodhacks. Super lovely couple)

immediately, we chose to book them for our Team outing. The owner is very helpful, it's like he's ready 24/7 to reply to our inquiries, on, before and even after we checked out at his place, they still guided us. They even let us check in as early as 10:00am (supposed to be 2pm) which
is a really big help to us especially since we're from Santa Rosa, Laguna pa and we had to leave early in Laguna to avoid the traffic. Even gave us links and lists of places where we can
go and visit on our way there so it's really worth it. 

The place is clean and their aircon units are cool, super close to the beach & surf spots so we really enjoyed it.
My family and I have a separate room so we still have privacy even though there are many of us. They also provided offer free mineral water and we had two refills but there was no problem with the owner.

Post,Cyndie Lopez,2019-07-30,"My family and I went to this resort on July 28, 2019 and I don't recommend this place because;
1. The breakfast has no taste. As far as I know, salt is cheap.  We chose bangus with egg and rice. As for the egg, I only cooked 3 pcs and divided it for the six of us.  Hopefully, I told them to cook it sunny side up. And take note, it's not a free breakfast. I paid for it. 125/person. The coffee, very strong, no extra sugar. And the staff is also lazy. It's good that we have enough food to last until morning. But, we are super hungry.

2. CR is dirty. Lots of soap stains on the tiles. At least, fix the cleaning. We booked 2 rooms. One room comes with soap and shampoo, which is great. But the other one, nothing. The towels in one room, fragrant, look like new laundry. But the other one, smelled from the trunk. 

3. Your big pool, set, 5ft minimum. But in reality, he is 7ft.  Woe to those who can't swim. Just to the side.  Of course we don't want to go to the kiddie pool. It's dirty. 

4. I did not see a lifeguard. Swim at your own risk.
I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the negative reviews about the resort are outdated. We said maybe it has improved. Case, it's the same. No improvements, based on past reviews. It's like a resort. In management, I hope you can see the reviews. From 2019 until now, same comments about your place.

Everything was walking distance: a 2 minute walk to the beach and the surfing spots, a 5 minute walk to the the bar restos where cover bands played at night, and a 10-15 minute walk to the party place. There was also a handy convenience store directly in front of the hostel, for the different emergencies you might encounter.

Post,Bryna Torres,2019-07-25,"If you are looking for a place to eat after work; school; in Katipunan area, then #TheYardAtTheXavierville is the perfect foodie place for you. It opens late afternoon to midnight; a foodie market feast. #TheYardAtTheXavierville caters numerous cuisines that will not leave you bored or umay from appetizer to dessert and it lives up to the expectation of being The Best foodie night market in the area.

When we got here my boyfriend and I personally chose #RusticBox ; they serve one of the best-tasting, budget-friendly-steak, hot-off-the-grill T-bone and Porterhouse steaks. The place itself is extra ordinary; thus - it is the streak that keeps loyal customers coming back. For just over a hundred bucks, a large piece of well-marinated, adequately-cooked, tender-juicy and aroma-filled steak with a cup of steamed rice is a very good deal, it is getting more than what you pay for. What they do best here is simple; its affordable T-Bone and Porterhouse Steaks, priced range from Php165- Php240 they grill it according to your preference. I must say their prices are truly affordable and their steaks are big. it is always amazing to find affordable places to have your steak fix - deliciously fixed. :) 

#TheYardAtTheXavierville is an open-air eatery along Xavierville Katipunan. We reached the place around 5pm and it is still packed as I post this. Supposed to give 4 stars but #RusticBox 's steaks were so affordable and tasty! So 5 stars it is!
